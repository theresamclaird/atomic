# Atomic
Atomic is a React component library consisting of

- Atoms: Simple React components
- Molecules: More complex components built from atoms
- Modules: JavaScript modules
- Themes: All components within Atomic are themed using Styled System

## Use

I built these components both for fun and to use on my personal projects. I make no guarantees that these work as expected or are even useful to anybody except myself. Use at your own risk.

## Installation

The package itself is published to github, and requires an access token to install.

```bash
npm install @theresamclaird/atomic
```

## Storybook

Components can be viewed from Storybook which is available publicly (see: https://www.atomiccomponentlibrary.com/). I recommend cloning the repository and spinning up Storybook locally:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# spin up storybook
npm run storybook
```

## Contributing
