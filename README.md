# Atomic
Atomic is a React component library consisting of both simple (atomic) React components and more complex components (molecules). I use these components in my personal projects.

## Installation

After cloning, cd into the folder and install dependencies with npm:

```bash
npm install
```

## Storybook

Components are rendered within Storybook, which can be started as follows:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

## Contributing
