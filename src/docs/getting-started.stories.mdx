# Getting Started

This is a library of React components and hooks that I use for my <a href="https://www.mclairdfamily.com/">personal projects</a>.

I make no guarantees that these are useful to anybody except myself, or that they even work as advertised. Use at your own risk.

## Installation

I do not anticipate anybody really wanting to install or use these components; in fact, if you are looking for React components, I suggest <a href="https://mui.com/">Material UI</a> as a more fully-featured component library. For a robust library of useful hooks, I suggest <a href="https://usehooks.com/">useHooks</a>.

When I created and published this package I made it private, meaning installation requires GitHub authentication and an auth token. If you really want to play with these components, I recommend just cloning the <a href="https://github.com/theresamclaird/atomic">repo</a>.

## Components

These components are built with <a href="https://styled-system.com/">Styled System</a> and <a href="https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction">Emotion</a>. They accept the same props that typical Styled System components take, for example `as` and `sx` props.

### The `as` Prop

Components accept an optional `as` prop:

```jsx
<Box as="ul">
  <Box as="li">A bullet point.</Box>
  <Box as="li">Another bullet point.</Box>
</Box>
```
### The `sx` Prop
Components accept an optional `sx` prop to declare theme-able styles and custom CSS:

```jsx
<Box sx={{ padding: 1, backgroundColor: 'background' }}>This will render a div containing this text.</Box>
```

### Shortcut CSS Declarations

<a href="https://styled-system.com/api">Styled System</a> allows for the use of shortcut labels on CSS declarations, for example:

```jsx
<Box sx={{ p: 1, bg: 'background' }}>This will render a div containing this text.</Box>
```

### Responsive CSS

One of my favorite features of Styled System is the powerful ability to declare styles for each breakpoint using an array:

```jsx
<Box sx={{ padding: [1, 2, 3] }}>The padding in this Box will change with each breakpoint.</Box>
```

An array of values assigned to a CSS declaration will apply those values at smallest-to-largest breakpoints in ascending index order. In the above example, the Box will use a padding value of 1 at the smallest breakpoint, and a padding value of 2 at the next largest breakpoint, and a value of 3 at the largest breakpoint.
