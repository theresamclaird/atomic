# Getting Started

This is a library of React components and hooks that I use for my <a href="https://www.mclairdfamily.com/">personal projects</a>.

I make no guarantees that these are useful to anybody except myself, or that they even work as advertised. Use at your own risk.

## Installation

Installation requires GitHub authentication and an auth token, so if you really want to use or play with these components, I recommend just cloning the <a href="https://github.com/theresamclaird/atomic">repo</a>.

## Components

These components were built with <a href="https://styled-system.com/">Styled System</a> and <a href="https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction">Emotion</a>, and they accept an optional `sx` prop for styling.

### The `as` Prop

Components accept an optional `as` prop:

```jsx
<Box as="ul">
  <Box as="li">A bullet point.</Box>
  <Box as="li">Another bullet point.</Box>
</Box>
```
### The `sx` Prop
Components accept an optional `sx` prop to declare theme-able styles and custom CSS:

```jsx
<Box sx={{ padding: 1, backgroundColor: 'background' }}>This will render a div containing this text.</Box>
```

### Shortcut CSS Declarations

<a href="https://styled-system.com/api">Styled System</a> allows for the use of shortcut labels on CSS declarations, for example:

```jsx
<Box sx={{ p: 1, bg: 'background' }}>This will render a div containing this text.</Box>
```

### Responsive CSS

One of my favorite features of Styled System is the powerful ability to declare styles for each breakpoint using an array:

```jsx
<Box sx={{ padding: [1, 2, 3] }}>The padding in this Box will change with each breakpoint.</Box>
```

An array of values assigned to a CSS declaration, applies those values at smallest-to-largest breakpoints. In the above example, the Box will use a padding value of 1 (rem) at the smallest breakpoint, and a padding value of 2 at the next largest breakpoint, and a value of 3 at the largest breakpoint. Read more about this in the <a href="https://styled-system.com/responsive-styles">Styled System documentation</a>.

## Theme

The <a href="https://github.com/theresamclaird/atomic/blob/main/src/themes/defaultTheme.js">default theme</a> declares styles for things like typography, spacing, colors, and breakpoints. These can be overriden with the `ThemeProvider` component.
