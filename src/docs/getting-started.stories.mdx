# Getting Started

This is a library of JavaScript modules, React components, and hooks that I use and experiment with for personal projects.

I make no guarantees that these are useful to anybody except myself, or that they even work as advertised. Use at your own risk.

## Installation

Installing this package requires authentication to github packages and an auth token to install. If you want to use, inspect, or even copy these components, I recommend just cloning the <a href="https://github.com/theresamclaird/atomic">repository</a>.

## Components

These components are built with <a href="https://styled-system.com/">Styled System</a> and <a href="https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction">Emotion</a>.

### The `as` Prop

Components accept an optional `as` prop, declaring the actual HTML tag rendered.

```jsx
<Box as="ul">
  <Box as="li">A bullet point.</Box>
  <Box as="li">Another bullet point.</Box>
</Box>
```

### The `sx` Prop

Components accept an optional `sx` prop to declare theme-able styles and custom CSS:

```jsx
<Box sx={{ padding: 1, backgroundColor: 'background' }}>This will render a div containing this text.</Box>
```

### Shortcut CSS Declarations

<a href="https://styled-system.com/api">Styled System</a> allows for the use of shortcut labels on CSS declarations, for example:

```jsx
<Box sx={{ p: 1, bg: 'background' }}>This will render a div containing this text.</Box>
```

### Responsive CSS

One of my favorite features of Styled System is the powerful ability to declare styles for each breakpoint using an array:

```jsx
<Box sx={{ padding: [1, 2, 3] }}>The padding in this Box will change with each breakpoint.</Box>
```

An array of values assigned to a CSS declaration will apply those values at smallest-to-largest breakpoints in ascending index order. In the above example, the Box will use a padding value of 1 at the smallest breakpoint, and a padding value of 2 at the next largest breakpoint, and a value of 3 at the largest breakpoint.
