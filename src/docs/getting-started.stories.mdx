# What is this?

This is a library of React components and hooks that I use for my <a href="https://www.mclairdfamily.com/">personal projects</a>.

I make no guarantees that these are useful to anybody except myself, or that they even work as advertised. Use at your own risk.

## Installation

Installation requires GitHub authentication and an auth token, so if you really want to use or play with these components, I recommend just cloning the <a href="https://github.com/theresamclaird/atomic">repo</a>.

## Components

These components were built with <a href="https://styled-system.com/">Styled System</a> and <a href="https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction">Emotion</a>, and they accept an optional `sx` prop for styling.
