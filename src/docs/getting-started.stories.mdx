# What is this?

This is a small library of atomic, reusable React components and hooks. I build these for my personal projects, for example:

- family website (see: https://www.mclairdfamily.com/)
- games (see: https://main.d1s1mgbx0jg3t8.amplifyapp.com/)

I make no guarantees that these are useful to anybody except myself, or that they even work as advertised. Use at your own risk.
