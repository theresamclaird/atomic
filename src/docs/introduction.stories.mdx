# Atomic Component Library

Atomic is a React component library consisting of

- Atoms: Simple React components
- Molecules: More complex components built from atoms
- Modules: JavaScript modules
- Themes: All components within Atomic are themed using Styled System
- Hooks: A small collection of various hooks.

## Repository

<a href="https://github.com/theresamclaird/atomic">Code is on github.</a>

## Usage

I built these components both for fun and to use on my personal projects. I make no guarantees that these work as expected or are even useful to anybody except myself. Use at your own risk.

## Installation

The package itself is published to github, and requires an access token to install.

```bash
npm install @theresamclaird/atomic
```

## Linting

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Testing

```bash
npm test
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Repository Hygiene

Coverage thresholds are set to 100%, and both testing and linting are run in a husky pre-commit hook.

## Publishing

```bash
npm run patch
```

## Storybook

```bash
npm run storybook
```

### Adding New Components
