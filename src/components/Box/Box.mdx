# Box

The Box is the most foundational component in the library, and is used to render themeable HTML tags.

## Default Box

The Box renders a `div` by default, which can be changed with the `as` prop described below.

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />

## Styling

Use the `sx` prop to provide styling.

<Canvas of={Stories.StyledBox} />

## HTML Tags

Use the `as` prop to declare the HTML tag used to render the Box.

<Canvas of={Stories.UnorderedList} />

## Flex

The Flex component is just a Box with `display: flex` applied. Yes, you could just declare a Box with `sx={{ display: 'flex' }}` but I find that having a component labeled "Flex" helps to identify it as being used for layout.

<Canvas of={Stories.FlexBox} />

## Grid

Similar to the Flex component, the Grid component assigns `display: grid` to a Box.

<Canvas of={Stories.GridBox} />
