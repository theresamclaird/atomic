# Image

Renders a responsive image that is rendered with `picture`, `source`, and `img` tags. The `alt` and `src` props are required.

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />
<Controls of={Stories.Default} />

## Responsive Image

Supply a sources prop consisting of an array of objects indicating image types and sizes. When sources is provided, the src prop is still required and will be used as a fallback.

<Canvas of={Stories.ResponsiveImage} />
<Controls of={Stories.ResponsiveImage} />

## Aspect Ratio Image

To prevent content shift after the image loads, an optional aspectRatio prop will wrap the image in a container taking up 100% of the available width and vertical space according to the supplied aspectRatio.

A level of art direction can be achieved with the sx prop, for example declaring object-fit and object-position on the image.
