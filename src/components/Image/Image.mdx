# Image

Renders a responsive image with `picture`, `source`, and `img` tags.

<Canvas of={Stories.Default} />
<Controls of={Stories.Default} />

## Responsive Image

Supply an optional `sources` prop consisting of an array of objects with `media` (optional) and `srcset` values. When `sources` is provided, the `src` prop is still required and will be used as a fallback.

<Controls of={Stories.ResponsiveImage} />

## Aspect Ratio Image

To prevent content shift after the image loads, an optional aspectRatio prop will wrap the image in a container taking up 100% of the available width and vertical space according to the supplied aspectRatio.

A level of art direction can be achieved with the sx prop, for example declaring object-fit and object-position on the image.
