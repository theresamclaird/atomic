# Image

The Image Component renders a responsive image.

## Basic Image

At its most basic, the Image component requires `alt` and `src` props, as well as an optional `sx` prop for styling.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Basic Image">
    <Image
      alt="Llama Cria"
      src="https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-300x185.webp"
      sx={{ width: 300 }}
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Responsive Image

An optional `sources` prop can be used to specify media and srcsets sources for images of different types (e.g. webp, jpg) as well as screen sizes. The `src` prop is still required, and is used as a fallback image.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Responsive Image">
    <Image
      alt="Llama Cria"
      src="https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-300x185.webp"
      sources={[
        { srcset: 'https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-300x185.webp 300w, https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-600x371.webp 600w, https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-900x556.webp 900w, https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-1200x742.webp 1200w, https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-2400x1483.webp 2400w, https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-3600x2225.webp 3600w' },
        { srcset: 'https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-300x185.jpg 300w, https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-600x371.jpg 600w, https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-900x556.jpg 900w, https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-1200x742.jpg 1200w, https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-2400x1483.jpg 2400w, https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-3600x2225.jpg 3600w' },
      ]}
    />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

## Aspect Ratio

To prevent content shift as the image loads, an optional `aspectRatio` prop will wrap the image in a container taking up 100% of the available width and an amount of vertical space indicated by the supplied `aspectRatio`.

A level of art direction can be achieved with the `sx` prop, for example declaring `object-fit` and `object-position`.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="Aspect Ratio">
    <Image
      aspectRatio={1}
      alt="Llama Cria"
      src="https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-300x185.webp"
      sources={[
        { srcset: 'https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-300x185.webp 300w, https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-600x371.webp 600w, https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-900x556.webp 900w, https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-1200x742.webp 1200w, https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-2400x1483.webp 2400w, https://mclairdfamily-images.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/demo-3600x2225.webp 3600w' },
