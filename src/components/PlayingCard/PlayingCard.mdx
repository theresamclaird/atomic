# Playing Card

Renders a standard playing card. Card pips and corners are rendered with HTML and CSS, except for the royal faces (Jack, Queen, King) which are rendered from SVG images. I used these to build a <a href="https://main.d1s1mgbx0jg3t8.amplifyapp.com/" target="_blank">Blackjack</a> game.
